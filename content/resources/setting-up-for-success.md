# Setting up for success
Have something that only gets done during treatments. Rotate a few things often. 
Get a good organization system.
Make it a convenient location.
Ideas for cabinets that fit vests and medication. 
If the sky's the limit, do a custom built-in.
Make the space cozy.
Good lighting.
Sensory Table with understorage -- ikea table with orbeez or water beads in it. Something contained but fun. Little legos inside those bins with a surface to build on would be excellent.
Printables are an excellent resource for things to do. Links to great printables on all sorts of topics.
Medication chart, some sort of sticker chart for transferring responsibility to child.
Simply on purpose family economy, merricks art for printable download, customize it to include vest treatments as part of the daily deals.
Hand sanitizer subscription and good kleenex solutions that look like home decor -- studio mcgee 1st aid box or something similar to that on amazon. 2 different colors, one for preventative cares (kleenex, neti pot if you do, hand sanitizer, sterilization materials, storing meds?) and one for normal emergency supplies. (bandaids, gauze, antibiotic ointment, painkillers, etc.)
How to include the vest in your home without making it look like a medical station (hey hey feng shui)
Charts for medications, calendars that say when rx was ordered and when it will be low etc. 

Coordinating care between providers. How do you track what has happened at which appointment? How do you keep on top of it when all of them arenâ€™t aware of what the other Dr. has seen?
