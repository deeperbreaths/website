# Setting up for success

### Tip #1: Keep activities fresh.
Have something that only gets done during treatments, and rotate a few things often. 
 * Check out our [From our kids to your kids](https://deeperbreaths.org/resources/from-our-kids-to-your-kids/) page for ideas that would work for you!

### Tip #2: Organize the chaos.
Get a good organization system, in a convenient location. 

 * I hope to add a few cabinets that would work to fit the vests without modifications. If the sky is the limit or if you are handy, do a custom built-in. It is worth having the equipment put away in a safe place, and ease of access to the medications, extra neb cups and masks, and the airway clearance machinery itself cuts down on set up and takedown time, and makes the therapies a cohesive part of the home rather than something to always be working around. Check back for links as I find cabinets or desks that fit most of the treatment options and allow for activities at the same time! 

* [Here is a metal cart](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NQJNV4F/ref=psdc_8521400011_t1_B07PPSXRSJ) that you could store the nebulizer, extra supplies, medications, and vest and tubes. It is a bit on the smaller side so not all machines will fit in there, though it would be handy to be able to roll everything away into a closet when not in use. The metal mesh allows for airflow as well.


* [Here is another variation in a pretty blue color.](https://www.amazon.com/CAXXA-3-Tier-Rolling-Storage-Organizer/dp/B07PPSXRSJ/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?keywords=storage%2Bcart&qid=1580506173&sr=8-2-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFWTVkwRklSNU1ITFgmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAyNTgwNDkyVTBXVko4QllaVUJGJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAxMzk4NTMzR0pGU1JCU0E5RlhKJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&th=1) Both of these have the limitation of not necessarily fitting everything, but the maneuverability might be the solution you need, if you need to be moving treatment locations often.

* [Here is a server cabinet](https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/gracie-oaks-stowmarket-32-wide-wood-server-w001437691.html) that would fit the vest, nebs, and supplies. It could even store some of the activities you might use during treatments, in bins on one of the shelves. Modify it with a small hole for cords to go through the back to plug in to an outlet, and manage the amount of cords you have. 

* [Here is another cabinet](https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/willa-arlo-interiors-hitchin-server-wrlo7854.html) that would be able to fit most of the supplies, and blend seamlessly into a main area. If it was in a dining room, treatments could be done at the dining table with all of the activities easily accessible. Depending on your machine, you may not be able to install the shelf in the middle so there is enough height.

* Maybe you thrive on brighter colors? [Try this colorful cabinet for storing the equipment!](https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/mercury-row-duffy-2-door-accent-cabinet-w000453705.html) Use bins inside to organize the medicines and extra supplies.

* [Here is a more traditional-looking cabinet that would work well.](https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/greyleigh-fincher-2-door-accent-cabinet-gryl4073.html) With its wood frame, it will be sturdy, yet it would be easy to make a cord-corralling hole in the panel backing.

* [If you want to store more in one spot, try this cabinet.](https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/gracie-oaks-colucci-reclaimed-glass-accent-cabinet-w001244515.html) Pair with cute storage containers like the [Studio McGee 1st aid box](https://www.mcgeeandco.com/products/first-aid-box) or [something similar to that on Amazon.](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Co-Op-DA7188-Enameled-First/dp/B01NBY5Z9T/ref=sr_1_1?crid=YH4JHZ9MN3Q7&keywords=metal+first+aid+box&qid=1580452181&sprefix=metal+first+ai%2Caps%2C226&sr=8-1) Add some cute kleenex boxes, hand sanitzer containers, baskets to corral supplies, and books and toys to keep things cute and organized. Take inspiration from McGee and Co with [this designer cabinet!](https://www.mcgeeandco.com/collections/bookcases-shelves/products/maddox-cabinet) Or if you have the budget for it, buy that one!

### Tip #3: Create a welcoming atmosphere.
Make the space cozy. No one likes to be uncomfortable. The vest machines are uncomfortable enough as it is, without the added environmental discomfort. If you are planning to do fun games or sensory equipment, have a comfortable place to sit. Have a cozy blanket to snuggle under. Have good lighting for reading books. Have chapstick nearby for applying when the nebulized solution might dry out sensitive skin. Make sure clothing is not going to be irritating anything under the vests. Work with your doctors and respiratory therapists to make sure the equipment is fitted and working properly. All of these things will help make treatments go more smoothly.

### Tip #4: Keep activities organized and age-appropriate.
For very young children starting therapies, it's very hard to sit still for the treatment. The only distraction tactic recommended to us was to let them watch something or provide some sort of visual stimulus (electronics). There are so many other options! Anything that captures their attention is a good thing. A sensory table with understorage can be a multi-purpose solution. It is a great way to provide an activity that is contained but fun. Little legos stored in that table in bins could be easily pulled out and swapped with water beads or orbeez, playdough or kinetic sand. Multiples of these bins can also be stored high, ready to be swapped out when one activity gets boring for the child. See the section on sensory activities on our [From our kids to your kids page](https://deeperbreaths.org/resources/from-our-kids-to-your-kids/) for ideas, products, and more links.

### Tip #5 Free supplemental activities are an easy swap.
Printables are an excellent resource for things to do. Think dot-to-dot, coloring pages, crosswords, optical illusions, learning pages, and much, much more! Here are some that I have found! I will update if we find other resources that have great activities. Feel free to reach out if there is something you are looking for that is not here!
* [https://activities.raisingourkids.com/](https://activities.raisingourkids.com/) for activity pages for younger kids.
* [https://www.allkidsnetwork.com/activities/](https://www.allkidsnetwork.com/activities/) has activities for a wider age range.
* [https://www.education.com/worksheets/](https://www.education.com/worksheets/) has activities that you can filter by grade and subject!
* [https://www.activityvillage.co.uk/printables](https://www.activityvillage.co.uk/printables) has a wide variety that include story starters, flash cards, buntings and artistic varieties, along with coloring pages and those types of things.

### Tip #6: Give the child ownership in their treatments.
Keep a medication chart, or some sort of sticker chart for transferring responsibility to the child. This will teach them self-sufficiency as well as personal responsibility, as well as helping the caregiver with the responsibilty of treatments. We recently started following [Ralphie Jacobs from Simply on Purpose](https://simplyonpurpose.org/) and using her [Family Home Economy](https://simplyonpurpose.org/resources/), which could be easily customized to include vest/neb treatments as part of the child's responsibility. Access her ideas, and check out [Merrick's Art for her version](https://www.merricksart.com/our-family-economy/) to see how a couple different families have used it. They provide printable downloads as well, if you sign up for their newsletter.

### Tip #7: Use home decor to keep medications organized and handy.
Have hand sanitizer availble and good kleenex box storage solutions that look like home decor. If they are out and accessible but still fit in with your home, it is a win-win all around. I am finding some solutions that would be able to be stocked with supplies and kept readily accessible, but still look like part of your home. In the meantime, here are my ideas: [Studio McGee 1st aid box](https://www.mcgeeandco.com/products/first-aid-box) or [something similar to that on amazon.](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Co-Op-DA7188-Enameled-First/dp/B01NBY5Z9T/ref=sr_1_1?crid=YH4JHZ9MN3Q7&keywords=metal+first+aid+box&qid=1580452181&sprefix=metal+first+ai%2Caps%2C226&sr=8-1) You could get them in two different colors, one for preventative cares (kleenex, neti pot if you do, hand sanitizer, sterilization materials, maybe storing meds?) and one for normal emergency supplies (bandaids, gauze, antibiotic ointment, painkillers, etc.). 

### Tip #8: Keep things looking nice and you will be motivated to keep things organized.
Can I reiterate that you should include the vest in your home without making it look like a medical station? (Hey hey, feng shui!) This is your home, not a doctor's office. Let's keep the sterile-feeling environment at the hospital, and keep the cozy and welcoming feeling at home. Still sterilize your supplies, though!

### Tip #9: Find your organization solution!
I am not good at remembering when I need to reorder medications. Some pharmacies will do that for you, as well as ship it directly to your home. That would be ideal! But if that is not an option for you, try use a calendar or charts for medications that say when a prescription was filled, and as you put it away safely, fill in when you need to reorder. The most helpful place for me is where I will see it daily. For some people, this is in their phone calendar. Others keep a daily planner. Some have it on a wall calendar. As this website comes together, I hope to add a chart that would be useful and able to be stored with or by the medications.  

### Tip #10: Be in control of your healthcare.
This is something that we are working on in our home: coordinating care between providers. How do you track what has happened at which appointment? How do you keep on top of it when all of them aren’t aware of what the other Dr. has seen? This has been a recurring issue over the last six years, and we are working to come up with a solution. We will share when we come up with something. In the meantime, feel free to let us know any of your tips or ideas. We would love to hear from you! What has worked for your home? What has been a challenge? What are you working to overcome? Let's work together in this area so we can all thrive!
