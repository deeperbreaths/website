# From our kids to your kids
Kids like variety! We like to do a few different things during our vest treatments to keep us occupied, and we like to switch things up so that it stays fun and doesn’t feel like a chore! We broke the activities up into categories, and our mom and dad will include links to buy them if those are available. 

### Sensory: 
* Homemade slime! We love to make slime and then play with it. Bonus if it smells good! This is not a great thing for super young kids because it can be messy.  [Here’s a fluffy slime recipe.](https://www.thebestideasforkids.com/fluffy-slime-recipe/) Use playdough tools to play with it too!

* Playdough! This can also be homemade. Here’s a good recipe from [The Sweeter Side of Motherhood.](https://www.thesweetersideofmommyhood.com/blog/general/2019/04/soft-homemade-playdough-recipe/) Bonus if you make it fun colors! We love to use regular dishes and utensils to cut and shape and build, but here are links for premade dough: [Link 1](https://www.amazon.com/Play-Pack-Case-Winter-Colors/dp/B07BC44JFC/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=play+dough&qid=1580278805&sr=8-4 ), [Link 2](https://www.target.com/p/play-doh-4pk-of-bright-colors/-/A-50693696 ), [and Link 3](https://www.target.com/p/play-doh-kitchen-creations-little-chefs-boxed-set/-/A-53432046), and [tool sets](https://www.amazon.com/Inxens-Playdough-Tools-Dough-Molds/dp/B06XWVJ6B2/ref=sxin_4_osp60-2225653c_cov?ascsubtag=2225653c-c09a-439e-902b-5433b25a2b0b&creativeASIN=B06XWVJ6B2&cv_ct_cx=play+dough&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osp.2225653c-c09a-439e-902b-5433b25a2b0b&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_wn=osp-search&keywords=play+dough&linkCode=oas&pd_rd_i=B06XWVJ6B2&pd_rd_r=e557bab0-9bb9-40d1-9203-e798f45e7f75&pd_rd_w=mDubu&pd_rd_wg=SsBh7&pf_rd_p=62c00474-6fe0-420f-9956-a05256e04b43&pf_rd_r=NQX6GAT4M7QF30ZSHJB7&qid=1580278716&sr=1-1-32a32192-7547-4d9b-b4f8-fe31bfe05040&tag=mlbonsitepub-20) for extra fun!

* Kinetic sand! Shape, form, pat, play...mom says this one is easier to vacuum up than playdough and way less messy than slime. [Link here.](https://www.target.com/p/kinetic-sand-beach-sand-kingdom-playset-with-3lbs-of-beach-sand-for-ages-3-and-up/-/A-53364407) 

* Water beads! These are a fun thing to play with in a bucket. [Check out these ones.](https://www.amazon.com/Leeche-Kids-Value-Package-Sensory-Decoration/dp/B07GNCB53G/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?keywords=water+beads&qid=1580279234&sr=8-3-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExQUZaMDUyUDRDMTBBJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNzgwNDkxMkZKNTJTN0hITlhFMiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMTcyMjUxMTVMSVQ1UThTTzVaRiZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) 

* Sensory things are a great alternate activity, and work great if you have a special place for them to keep them contained. Try this [Ikea table](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/flisat-childrens-table-50298418/) that can have bins for storing directly under the tabletop! [This from Target looks good](https://www.target.com/p/ecr4kids-2-station-sand-and-water-adjustable-activity-play-table-center-with-lids-square-red-blue/-/A-78723849) or these from Amazon: [option 1](https://www.amazon.com/KidKraft-Round-Storage-Table-Natural/dp/B00L3NQQKQ/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=kids+play+table&qid=1580278598&sr=8-3), [option 2.](https://www.amazon.com/KidKraft-Activity-Table-Board-Natural/dp/B00MNQPRK2/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=kids+play+table&qid=1580278633&sr=8-13)

* We will always love painting. Just make sure it’s washable!

### Building:
* We love to build things! It is fun to get a new little set of Lego every once in awhile. Start the vest, build the set, play, and you forget you were tied down! Here are some of our favorite sets: 
  * [Young kids set.](https://www.target.com/p/lego-duplo-classic-deluxe-brick-box-10914-starter-set-with-storage-box/-/A-76555787)
  * [Kindergarten: set 1](https://www.target.com/p/lego-classic-bricks-and-houses-11008-kids-8217-building-toy-starter-set/-/A-76555800)
  * [Kindergarten: set 2](https://www.target.com/p/lego-trolls-world-tour-poppy-8217-s-pod-41251-playhouse-building-set/-/A-76555709)
  * [Early School: set 1](https://www.target.com/p/lego-friends-nature-glamping-41392-building-kit-includes-lego-friends-mia-a-mini-doll-tent-and-a-toy-bicycle-241pc/-/A-76555865)
  * [Early School: set 2](https://www.target.com/p/lego-city-police-highway-arrest-60242-building-set-for-kids/-/A-76555861)
  * [Older kids: set 1](https://www.target.com/p/lego-harry-potter-quidditch-match-75956/-/A-53458085)
  * [Older kids: set 2](https://www.target.com/p/lego-architecture-san-francisco-21043/-/A-75559088)

These get expensive quickly! It’s best to buy an open-ended set that can be played with freely, and save these sets for those times when you need to celebrate milestones or really need to get lots of treatments done in a day.

* If you want to work on your steady hand under pressure, try a Snap Circuits kit! We just got one and it has been great fun learning how to make circuits and learning about different paths that power can go from a battery to an object. [Here is the set we have](https://www.amazon.com/Snap-Circuits-SC-300-Electronics-Exploration/dp/B0000683A4/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=snap+circuits&qid=1580279351&sr=8-4 ), and [here is a link to a smaller set.](https://www.amazon.com/Snap-Circuits-SC-100-Electronics-Exploration/dp/B00008BFZH/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=snap+circuits&qid=1580279401&sr=8-5) 


### Educational Computer:
What kid doesn’t like electronics time? Our mom says that she loves when we do our treatments without complaining, and these things tend to work well for that:
* Prodigy: this is a free-to-play math game online. It does need a computer and internet to work, but it’s a good mix between a fun wizard game and doing math facts to cast spells! Plus, we like to collect cute pets. You sign up for a free account and customize your character, and when you sign up you can pick which grade you are in so it will customize the math problems you have to do to win the battles. [Start playing here!](https://www.prodigygame.com/)

* Duolingo: We have been learning Spanish with this free app! It’s fun, and comes in the app version or is available on their website! [Hablas Espanol?](www.duolingo.com)

* Khan Academy Kids: This is another educational app. This is the kids version, but there is also a version for older kids that teaches things. Maybe for those days that you have to miss school, this would be a good tutoring app! [Here is a link to their website.](www.khanacademy.org)

* Typing club games for [practicing typing.](www.typingclub.com) 

* ABC Mouse: a learning app for younger kids. You can also visit [their website for a free trial!](www.abcmouse.com)

* Starfall: another learning app for younger kids. [Visit their website to learn more!](www.starfall.com)

* There are many educational apps that teach how to read, how to do math, or explore deeper into topics that are interesting to kids! Any of those have worked for us.

* Teaching Textbooks: video math lessons, assignments, and quizzes for third grade on up. [Visit their website!](www.teachingtextbooks.com)

* Art for Kids Hub on youtube is a great resource for kids interested in drawing. [Clear, easy tutorials with an adult and child example.](https://www.youtube.com/user/ArtforKidsHub)

* Em Winn on Amazon Prime Video is a good one for learning how to draw and paint pictures.

* Amazon Prime Video has a lot of documentaries on it! Search for a topic that is interesting and see what you find!

* Curiosity Streams is a very cheap service that has only documentaries on it. Many, many topics ranging from nutrition to squirrels to flooding on Miami Beach to the history of George Washington or the Science of the immune system. Sitting, learning, and staying healthy all at once!

### Interaction:
Doing the lung treatments can be lonely or boring. We love when our siblings play games with us. Some games we (kindergarten through 3rd grade, but parents enjoy these ones too!) have played recently are:
 * [Exploding Kittens](https://www.amazon.com/Exploding-Kittens-LLC-EKG-ORG1-1-Card/dp/B010TQY7A8/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=Exploding+kittens&qid=1580354269&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFWUjNWMkNQSU4yMUMmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA5NDc2NDgzUVpSOENUUDI3WDdSJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA2MTQxMTgxVEFEMllXSko1NzEyJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==) 
 * [Forbidden Island](https://www.amazon.com/Gamewright-317-Forbidden-Island-Card/dp/B003D7F4YY/ref=sr_1_2?crid=6L3NIKNLWSH6&keywords=forbidden+island&qid=1580354365&sprefix=Forbidden+I%2Caps%2C261&sr=8-2)
 * [Between Two Cities](https://stonemaiergames.com/games/between-two-cities/)
 * [Ravine](https://www.amazon.com/Ravine-Crafty-Cooperative-Card-Game/dp/B07JCB7DH1/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=ravine+game&qid=1580354528&sr=8-2)

We do also sometimes read on our own, or color on our own. We like color by number, and the new sticker by number books.
 * [Here's one](https://www.target.com/p/brain-games-sticker-by-number-animals-spiral-bound/-/A-77984446)
 * [Here's another](https://www.amazon.com/Brain-Games-Sticker-Number-Treasures/dp/1645580342/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=sticker+by+number&qid=1580354602&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUE5TkFPQjVXSDgxVkYmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA2NjQzMzIzTTJPT0VXQzI2R0dHJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA3MzUwNjdWSUVENDlJSzBJWjQmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl) 

Those can be frustrating to do when you are vibrating from the treatments, though. We like listening to our mom and dad reading books to us, and a good kid-friendly series are the Who is/What was educational books that teach the history of different people and events. We just finished What was the Statue of LIberty  and Who Were the Wright Brothers? 

### Note from Mom: 

Variety during treatments helps keep them interesting, especially if doing 3-4 that day. If your kids know some sort of routine, it helps cut down on complaints. Example: Monday morning is reading. Monday evening is Prodigy math. Posting a schedule helps, too! It cuts down on the “What can I do?” questions that inevitably arise due to being stuck in one spot for a specified time. My kids have great imaginations, yet when their scope and focus is confined to that one spot for a “very long time,” they suddenly need direction. A jumping-off point is very helpful so they know what to expect, and you have the flexibility to swap it up as needed.

Head to the printables (link coming soon!) page for a sample schedule, and a blank one for you to customize to your family’s needs.
