# From our kids to your kids
It's hard to sit still for the treatment time. Favorite things to do during vests: Prodigy math game, little legos -- especially new sets, Art for kids hub on youtube, Em Winn on Amazon Prime Video, Curiosity Streams, playing with siblings with toys, parents reading books (Who is/What was series is educational and great for kids 2nd - 6th or beyond), coloring books, color by number. Khan Academy kids. Of course apps are always a hit. Duolingo for learning Spanish. Typing club games for practicing typing. Anything NEW is a hit. Slime/Playdough/kinetic sand at a sensory table. Apps that teach or allow for exploration into topics the kids are interested in do well. For young kids, Abc mouse. Starfall. Learning how to read apps. For kids who maybe struggle in a school subject, an online tutoring program for that. Teaching textbooks for easy math lessons starting in 3rd grade. 

Variety during treatments helps keep them interesting, especially if doing 3-4 that day. But if kids know some sort of routine it helps cut down complaints. Monday morning is reading. Monday evening is Prodigy math. Sample schedule. Posted helps too! Cuts down on the “What can I do?” questions that inevitably arise due to being stuck in one spot for a specified time. My kids have great imaginations, yet when their scope and focus is confined to that one spot for a “very long time,” they suddenly need direction. A jumping-off point is very helpful so they know what to expect, and you have the flexibility to swap it up as needed.
