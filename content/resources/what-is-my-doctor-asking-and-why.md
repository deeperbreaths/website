### What is my doctor asking and why?

Have you ever felt like you go into an appointment and get interrogated? The doctor asks
* How often do you do this? 
* How long do you do that? 
* What sort of things do you notice when you do this? 
* How does that make you feel?
* When did you notice these symptoms?
* How long have they persisted?
  
We hope to help you understand why the doctor asks the questions he or she asks, and how to feel confident you are giving them accurate information.

### Understanding your child

Let’s say your child is about six months old. This means you have probably spent approximately 4,000 hours with him or her. Now, meet your doctor. At this point in time, the doctor has spent maybe an hour or two with your child. In order to understand your child, they need to ask questions about behaviors, eating patterns, and other tangible data so they can best advise you. You know your child far more intimately than they do. They know risk factors, data points, symptoms, and things of that nature. You know your child and what is normal for him or her. Your doctors ask questions to help understand your child.

### Establishing a baseline

Doctors also need to establish a baseline for your child. Every person has their own unique fingerprint, and think of a baseline as your health fingerprint. It is your normal, everyday, healthy functioning status. This gets established over time through recorded growth patterns, documented blood pressures and vital statistics, and weight measurements.  It also gets recorded through lung function tests and things that measure organ function. Another way it gets measured is simply through asking how many illnesses have occurred between doctor visits, and figuring out the severity of those. Any type of change that is away from the normal (Johnny sneezes 5 times per day when he used to sneeze just once!) is something the doctor takes into consideration, to determine whether the current care plan is working. If there are changes that seem to be negatively affecting health, this is incredibly important information for the doctor to uncover; they ask questions to make sure they don’t miss anything. They are trained to notice symptoms.

### Providing quality care

Doctors go into the medical profession because they want to help better the lives of their patients. Your doctor may be asking questions to find out if there are any pain points in your life that they can help with. This might include changing a medication to avoid a side effect, or simply prescribing a 3 month supply and specifying that to the pharmacy so you don’t risk running out. It might include referring you to resources that might help you deal with any of the fringe concerns that come along with the medical cares, such as referrals to a social worker or therapist to help in more specific ways. Also, chances are good that they would like to get to know you.

### Why do I get asked the same question over and over?

Sometimes it feels like you get asked the same thing over and over again, to the point where you can start second-guessing yourself about what actually is going on. This is a common technique when questioning someone, and it is meant to gain a clear, full picture of the situation. It is not meant to come from the standpoint of an interrogator, though it can feel like an interrogation. It is simply important to ask the same question in a few different ways, since the fifth time might be the time that you remember that, “Oh, yeah! He did have a cough last week but I forgot about it because I was busy being sick with the flu!” It is a way of verifying that all information came out, and that the information stays consistent.

### How to be prepared for an appointment

Understanding is the biggest tool in your toolbelt here. I am no expert on personal organization, so I like to keep that general understanding of what a doctor needs to know from me in my head. This way, I can notice general health patterns and be able to convey that to the doctor. Others like to be more specific, and document illness or out-of-the-ordinary health events. If you prefer this method, you can keep a planner or a health journal. This is an incredibly useful place to record any questions or concerns you might have so you don’t forget to bring them up. There will almost always be takeaways from appointments as well, and a planner or journal is a good place to record these. Sometimes these might be action items, like changing the programming of the airway clearance therapy machine. Some might be recommended products or referrals to helpful resources. Others might simply be directions for how best to combine therapies and treatments. Knowing that an appointment requires information to be given and information to be received has been very helpful for me, in making sure that I provide the most accurate information possible to my doctor. I need to work on remembering and recording the advice they have for me! 

Hopefully this information has helped you understand why you are asked so many questions, and hopefully it helps you feel more confident about the doctor-patient relationship!
