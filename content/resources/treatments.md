# Airway Clearance Therapy

 
www.smartvest.com

# IPV - Intrapulmonary Percussive Ventilation
delivers small bursts of air through a mouthpiece into lungs, vibrates chest, loosens mucus deep in airways. Www. verywellhealth.com

# OHFO - Oral High Frequency Oscillation
low volume, high frequency jet oscillation to lungs through a mouthpiece. Uses sound frequency, helps clear carbon dioxide and sputum.   Same website

# PEP - Positive Epiratory Pressure
use facemask or mouthpiece while inhaling and exhaling as normal. A mechanical devices creates resistance so air enters the small airways in your lungs, creating pressure that gently dislodges sputum. This gets pushed towards the larger airways making it easier to cough up. Same website. Astra PEP, Pari PEP, and AeroPEP.

# Flutter Mucus Clearance System
combines PEP therapy with high frequency oscillation, a controlled vibration system that gently oscillates the large and small airways in the lungs. Creates vibrations upon exhale, helping loosen mucus from bronchial walls while acceleration airflow to stimulation mucus clearance. A cough is usually stimulated after several exhales. Same website. Caveat, wonâ€™t work if overly obstructed airways. Acapella, cornet, Aerobika OPEP.

# HFCWO - High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation
inflatable vest uses air pressure to vibrate the chest wall, increasing airflow to smaller passages and aiding in mucus clearance. Usually cycles 5 min of treatment, a break for coughs, then another treatment. We use this for everyday treatments, they last 35min (with a prep period and a put away period. We plan for 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the excitement level of the distraction used during the treatment). Vest airway Clearance System, Medpulse Respiratory Vest System, others?

# Lung Flute Acoustic Induction Device -
handheld device that generates low-frequency sound waves in the airways as you vigorously exhale through a reeded mouthpiece. Similar to a reed instrument. The sound waves travel down into the lower airways and stimulate mucus clearance.

These devices are generally used in conjunction with the Huff cough technique, controlled coughing, chest percussion, or postural drainage, and medication like a bronchodilator inhaler to widen airway passages and/or mucolytic to thin mucus.
