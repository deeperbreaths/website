# About Us

Hello! We are Karen and Steve, parents of soon-to-be six kids, two of whom are diagnosed with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia. We will see about the sixth after he is born! We have been navigating the space and lifestyle of airway clearance treatments for almost six years now, and thought that we could share some things we have learned along the way. Stop in, explore, and learn how to live a full life by taking deeper breaths!

# Why Deeper Breaths?

When we first got the news that our daughter was diagnosed with a genetic disorder, I clearly remember feeling at a loss. It felt like the resources available were very much directed at keeping kids out of the hospital, but there was not a large pool of resources available for thriving within the world of meds, nebs, vests, and frequent Dr. visits. We hope to change that by being a resource for parents to find information to make their airway clearance lives easier. You are not alone! Even though the diagnosis may be unclear, or a rare disorder, there are people all over the world dealing with the same things.
