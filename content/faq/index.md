# What is primary ciliary dyskinesia? 

Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia is an inherited disorder that affects cilia. Cilia are tiny, hair-like structures in various places in the body, including the airways, sinuses, and ear canals. The structures form incorrectly, causing difficulties in clearing mucus. There may also be differences in the organ placement in the abdomen, with some or all organs reversed. Some have heart defects, and some have no spleen or multiple spleens. Though all the genes causing this disorder are not yet known, research is being done to isolate which genes have the mutations that cause PCD. www.pcdfoundation.org/faq/ is an excellent resource for finding more in-depth information.

# What is COPD?

COPD stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder. 

# What are airway clearance therapies?

Airway clearance therapies are treatments used to help bodies out when they are having difficulty clearing mucus from the airways. There are a couple different methods and devices used, but in general people sit for a treatment wearing a vest that compresses and vibrates mucus from the smaller alveoli in the lungs, so it can be coughed out. Typically done in conjunction with nebulized medicine, the theory is that aggressive proactive treatment will prevent lung infections and lung damage, leading to a longer and higher quality of life. This is the best medical practice at the moment based on current research and therapies.
